            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READERS, To whom it doth or may any wayes concern.</head>
            <p>MAny and frequent have been the clam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors of ſome infatuated Spirits of this diſtempered Age, who (like the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vel, that Arch enemy to all good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Order) labor to bring all things into confuſion; yea (if poſſible, into the Original Chaos againſt the Common Laws of this Nation, and the practice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. I muſt confeſs their pretences, though they are as falſe as malicious, do yet ſeem ſpecious and fair in appearance, and are too apt to take with the vulgar and ignorant; and no wonder, for they (<hi>Athenian</hi>-like) pleaſed with novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb facs="tcp:100357:6"/> and conſtant to nothing but inconſtancy, are ever thirſting after change and alteration (though to the worſe) as children long to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry their Sports, and ſhift their Toyes and Bau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. It is true, that all Creatures (man onely excepted) do obſerve the Rules of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, preſcribed unto them in a conſtant and ſetled way, but he by his fall did looſe that perfection, and hath (thereby) not onely ſubjected the Creature, but himſelf to vanity and vexation of Spirit: this is not onely true of man, in his <hi>puris naturalibus,</hi> but even of thoſe whoſe Souls are hightened above the common pitch, by civil education, and good literature; yea even of Gods dear children who have thoſe extraordinary Characters of his ſtrength and goodneſs fixed upon them, and ſee things with a clearer light then meer Nature improved to the utmoſt can afford: So truely may that Ancient and common ſaying, be applyed to all, <hi>Mens humana novitatis avida.</hi> That therefore many things are (oftentimes) diſliked and inveighed againſt, even by well-meaning, and (otherwiſe) diſcreete men, is no found concluſion, that they are naught and fit, either to be aboliſhed or reformed, but that mens minds are unſettled and reſtleſs, and not long to be ſatisfied with any thing, be it (in it ſelf) never ſo excellent and deſirable.
<pb facs="tcp:100357:6"/> This truth is abundantly manifeſted by <hi>Solo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon</hi> the wifeſt and greateſt of men of his Age (if not of any ſince) in his book called the Preacher, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. 1. and 2. Theſe things conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (though in my Judgement, who have for this ſix and thirty years laſt paſt and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, been a Student of the Common Laws, and for a great part of that time, carefully obſerved the general practice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; yea, I believe alſo of many more, far more ancient in time, and of far deeper judgments, and more eminent in parts then my ſelf) there is not to be found, either in the Laws themſelves, or in the practice there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, any ſuch conſiderable inconveniences, or of ſuch dangerous conſequence as hath been, and yet is (by ſome) pretended, I do not think it ſtrange to have heard ſo loud cryes, and calumnies, of late falſly voiced and printed againſt them. Endeavors and expedients have been prudently ſtudyed, and warily put in practice, by the Grave and Learned Judges and Sages of this Nation, to give ſatisfaction unto, and to prevent greater miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs (if poſſible) which might ariſe from the unſetledneſs of this <hi>Nulli-legian</hi> brood, by ordering and regulating as much as might be (without impairing the excellencies of the Laws themſelves, and the due and ready
<pb facs="tcp:100357:7"/> adminiſtration of equal Juſtice) thoſe things againſt which (they conceived) there was or could be any colour or ſhadow of excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; but how theſe men have been ſatisfied therewith, or whether the people have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived (hereby) that general benefit, as was ſuppoſed, I leave to the Learned to judge, and to thoſe that have made experience thereof. For my own part, I muſt confeſs I cannot yet conceive (alwayes ſubmitting to better Judgements) that our Common Laws, and the practice thereof, which are of ſo great antiquity, and have been from Age to Age to this preſent time refining and working into this modle, and ſo happily continued, not only to the good and flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this Nation in our own Country, but to the making of us (thereby) famous and renowned through the whole Chriſtian World, can admit of a ſuddain alteration for the better, but do rather fear that experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will in time manifeſt (if it doth not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready too much appear) that as great, if not greater inconveniences may fall out to the people by thoſe alterations that have been already made, then there did uſually happen before they were undertaken and put in practice: So difficult, nay ſo dangerous a thing it is on the ſuddain, and by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb facs="tcp:100357:7"/> of a few, though Learned and diſcreet men to better that which hath been the ſtudy, and conſtant endeavor of many Ages to bring to that excellency, perfection, and beauty, in which the judicious, with joy and content, do behold it to appear. I ſpeak not this to reflect upon the Judgements or actions of thoſe that have aſſayed any thing in this kind, I know they are placed in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Orbes above me, and may ſee much fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and will therefore rather conclude my ſelf to be ſhort ſighted in apprehending, then ſay there hath been any miſtakes in the not right ſtating of things; Nor do I hope thereby to ſtop the clamorous mouths of the malicious and ignorant; for this would be as much folly, as <hi>Surdo cancre,</hi> or to preſent colors to the blind to diſtinguiſh of, when their impudence is grown leſs, and their knowledge greater, it will be then (and not till then) a fit time to beſpeak them with reaſon, till when I leave them. But my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire and intentions herein are in part to ſettle the wavering minds of ſuch, who though they are not over-ſwayed with a prejudicate opinion, or ſo much raiſed with ſelf-inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>eſt, to run clean beſide the fair mark of good Laws, Order and Government, may yet be unreſolved in their judgements, what
<pb facs="tcp:100357:8"/> to determine concerning thoſe Laws and the practice thereof, which have been (of late) without any reſtraint, ſo much vilified and deſpiſed; And this is alſo one cauſe which moved me to give way to the publiſhing of this enſuing Treatiſe, that they may there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by receive information, not from me, but from the Oracles of the Law, the grave and Learned Judges of the <hi>Upper Bench,</hi> and more particularly from the mouth of that upright ſtout and poliſhed Pillar of the Law, the late Lord Chief Juſtice ROLLE, what the Law and the practice thereof is and hath been for theſe latter years, yea even at that very time, wherein they were ſo much, and ſo falſly clamoured againſt, wherein I doubt not but there may be found to be by thoſe that will and can underſtand it, ſo much reaſon, and ſuch univerſal and impartial Juſtice in the Laws themſelves, and ſo much care and circumſpection, daily uſed in the general parctice of them, for the equal and ſpeedy diſtribution thereof, that they ſhall not need a Champion to ſtand up in their vindication. As for thoſe miſcarriages which do ſometimes (and it may be too often) fall out in the retarding of Juſtice to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of the Clyents, I dare ſay, that they are uſually occaſioned, either by their own
<pb facs="tcp:100357:8"/> negligence or wilfulneſs, and are not to be charged upon others; and for thoſe that do befall them other wayes, either by the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or falſity of thoſe they intruſt, which ſo long as man is but man, may ſometimes be; you will find that they are no ſooner diſcovered and complained of in the right place, but they are rectified, and (if there be cauſe) the offences exemplary puniſhed, and all poſſible care that may be (from time to time) taken to prevent and meet with the like inconveniences for the future; ſo far are and have bin the Sages of the Law at all times from countenancing or tolerating any thing, that may ſtop or obſtruct the ſtream of Juſtice from flowing readily and indifferently to all. For the Book it ſelf, I cannot call it a perfect Work, you ſee I aver it to be no more then a few years Collections and Obſervations thereupon; and indeed they were onely ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken for private uſe, without any thoughts of making them publike, yet ſuch as it is I conceive it may not altogether prove uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; for it being the firſt eſſay of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture that I find endeavoured or put forth by any, it may, if it may nothing elſe, at leſt encourage others hereafter, to make a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther progreſs in this kind (now that the way is pointed at) then the ſhort ſpace of time,
<pb facs="tcp:100357:9"/> allotted me to travail in, hath ſuffered me to do, and to add heaps to my gleannings, and to nouriſh up this my Babe to ſuch a growth and perfection, that it may (happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) when I am gone, forget its firſt Parent, and own another name and Author, as I have known ſome books to have done. It may alſo be (probably) ſome direction to thoſe that begin to practice at the Bar, but eſpecially in the Court of the <hi>Upper Bench;</hi> how to practice fairely, and with ingenui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to make motions, befitting the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and wiſdome of the Court to grant, and may ſtand with modeſty and diſcretion, in relation to themſelves to move, and not frivolous and uſeleſs, yet chargeable to the Clyent; and though it be not worthy to be an Inſtructer to the long experienced, and ready practicer, to whom I preſume few things of this kind can prove new and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard of; yet way it (perchance) at ſome time or other, be their remembrancer of thoſe things (though but ordinary) which multiplicity of buſineſs will not ſuffer them on the ſuddain to call to mind, a thing which I have often obſerved to befall many able and well-verſed practicers, and no won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, for the beſt memories do often prove treacherous. I have made it my buſineſs to
<pb facs="tcp:100357:9"/> obſerve with diligence, and to render with candor, not mine own, but the ſence of the Court in all things, and as neer as I could in the very words they were delivered, yet (many things being ſpoken <hi>obiter,</hi> and all men ſubject to miſ-apprehenſions, and my ſelf (it may be) as much as others. I will not labor, either to free the book (wholly) from errors, nor my ſelf from miſtakes, but leave both to the Readers candid conſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and cenſure. Thou maiſt perchance think it ſtrange that ſo ample a ſubject as the Title of the book ſets forth, ſhould ſwell it to no bigger a volume; and alſo ask me why upon many of the heads in the book, which in themſelves do afford ſuch copious matter, I am ſo brief and conciſe. For the firſt know, that my pretentions are not (at thou mayeſt ſee in the very Title of the Book, and through the whole Book it ſelf, and which I have alſo already hinted unto thee) to give thee a compleat Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of all things, belonging to each head, which I do finde and have read, delivered <hi>Sparſim</hi> in our Books, but onely the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of ſuch things, which I have heard and taken with my own hand at the Bar for ſome years laſt paſt, much whereof, I am confident thou canſt not find elſewhere in
<pb facs="tcp:100357:10"/> print, and this is alſo in the ſecond place the true reaſon why upon ſome of the heads I am ſo ſhort which might have been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, would have been far larger, for as things were (occaſionally) from time to time delivered by the Court, ſo were they taken, and ſo are they offered unto thee, and not otherwiſe, ſaving my endeavours to explain ſome things which by reaſon of the ſhort delivery of them, ſeemed more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure then others, and that not onely for the eaſier underſtanding of the younger Stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, but alſo (if it were poſſible) to ſatisfie thoſe great Antagoniſts of the Law and the practice thereof (who have need to have things made very plain and eaſie to them) how much they have been out of the way in their vilifying and laboring to deſtroy that which is ſo excellent in it ſelf, and by which (next under God) we are not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly continued to be a people, but are alſo rendred a peaceful and a flouriſhing Nation, and which I am confident mauger the malice of thoſe that wiſh and hope the contrary, will remain and flouriſh amongſt us, untill for our ſins God ſhall ſay (which I hope in his mercy he will not) I have no pleaſure in you, but ſhall ſuffer a Foreign enemy (as hath been heretofore done) to take away not
<pb facs="tcp:100357:10"/> onely our Laws and Liberties, but our Land and Nation. If any ſhall ſay that my own intereſt hath warmed my zeal to this temper, and renders what I have ſaid ſuſpicious of belief, I muſt anſwer them that I am indeed of the profeſſion of the Law, and I am not aſhamed of it, for I believe it to be not only an honeſt but an ingenious and honorable calling, and (in it ſelf) not mercenary, as it is by ſome ſaid to be, and too corruptly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſo made by many others: but for the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage I have hitherto made by it, or believe I ſhall ever do, in the way of profit, I might and may yet as eaſily be contented it ſhould be taken away as moſt, if not any of them, that cry ſo loudly againſt it; onely (I believe) with this difference, I deſire to keep that title <hi>Quelque choſe,</hi> that I have of mine own, <hi>pur faire bouillir la marmite,</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> ſaying hath it, and with which, I am I thank God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented under the protection of the Laws, and they to get what they have not from others, <hi>jure ſive injuria,</hi> it matters them not, and that there may be no Law to check or puniſh their unbridled deſires and unlawful actions; did not then the enſuing Treatiſe abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prove the truth of that litle I have ſaid in defence of our Laws and the practice thereof, I ſhould not doubt but my ſingle and bare
<pb facs="tcp:100357:11"/> averment of a truth ſo well known unto many would ſooner be believed, then their many foul calumnies, ſpeaking their own intereſts, though in diſguiſed and fair words and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences. I ſhall ſay no more, but leave what I have ſaid to thy judicious conſideration, and the Book to thy ſerious peruſal and favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able acceptance.</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">E</seg>Very Atturney of the Upper Bench, ought to attend in the Court at the ſecond return of the Term, by the Ancient Rules of the Court, for the quicker diſpatch of Juſtice to be done to the people; and for that reaſon, if they did not, they were to be put out of the Roll: and it was then Ordered that the Ancient Rules of the Court for Regulating of the Atturnies in their practice, ſhould be renewed and ſet up in the Kings Bench Office, <hi>Hill.</hi> 21. <hi>Car. Banc. Reg.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One may not repeal a Warrant of Atturney gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to an Atturney to appear for him, to the intent to defraud the Plaintiff of his appearance, but the Atturney ought by the Rules of the Court to appear for him, according to the Rules of the Court, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:100357:19"/> his Warrant be ſo repealed, <hi>Trin.</hi> 22. <hi>Car. B. r.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If an Atturney do practice deceitfully, an Attatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment lies againſt him out of this Court, at the prayer of the party grieved, if he make it appear to the Court, and good coſts ſhall be given againſt him, 22. <hi>Car. B. r.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An Atturney and his Clerk were both committed by the Court for entring things againſt expreſs Rules of the Court, and after notice of thoſe Rules given them by the Atturney of the other ſide, 22. <hi>Car. B. r.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One Atturney ought not to ſuffer another Attur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney to practice in his name, by reaſon of many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies that often happen to the Clyents by this means, 22. <hi>Car. B. r.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One <hi>G. H.</hi> an Atturney was ordered to be put out of the Roll of Atturneyes, for entring a judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt an expreſs Rule in Court, <hi>Mich. Car.</hi> 22. <hi>B. r.</hi> but it was not done.</p>
                  <p>The proper place for the Atturney General to ſit upon any ſpecial matters, wherein his attendence is required in Court, is under the Judges, on the left hand of the Clerk of the Crown, <hi>Mich.</hi> 22. <hi>Car. B. r.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No Under Sheriff ought to be Atturney, for it is often the cauſe of encreaſing of Suits, and alſo a hindrance in diſpatch of Clyents cauſes, <hi>Trin.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Atturney of the Plaintiff or Defendant do dye hanging the Suite, and the other party whoſe Atturney is dead, have notice given of it, and will not retain another Atturney to proſecute for him, the other party may proceed, and is not bound to hinder his Clyents cauſe for it, <hi>Mich.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:100357:19"/>
                  <p>The Plaintiff or Defendant may change his Attur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney pending the Suite, without leave of the Court, but it is not fair practice to do it without juſt cauſe, <hi>Mich.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It was the old courſe in proceeding in an Action of Treſpaſs and Ejectment, to deliver the Leaſe of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectment to the party to whom the Plaintiff had made a Letter of Atturney to execute the Leaſe, and for the Atturney to deliver poſſeſſion of the Land, upon the delivery of the Leaſe, <hi>Paſc.</hi> 24. <hi>Car. reg.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If one have a Letter of Atturney to deliver a Deed to another, and alſo authority from the party by word of mouth to do it, he may make uſe of which of theſe he will to do it by, but not of both, for the firſt that he makes uſe of ſhall be effectual, and the other ſhall be void, <hi>Paſc.</hi> 24. <hi>Car. B. r.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>An Infant ought not to appear to an Action by an Atturney, but by his Guardian; for he cannot retain an Atturney, but the Court may aſſigne him a Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian, <hi>Paſc.</hi> 24. <hi>Car. B. r.</hi>

                  <p>An Aſſumpſit grounded upon a conſideration which was paſt before the promiſe made, is a good Aſſumpſit, if it be alledged to be made at the inſtance, or requeſt of the Defendant. <hi>Pſac.</hi> 24. <hi>Car. B. r.</hi>

                  <p>Where one becomes legally indebted to another, the Law creates a promiſe, that he will pay this debt; and if he do not pay it, there is a ſufficient ground for the party to whom he is indebted, to bring his Action of <hi>Indebitatus Aſſumpſit,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt

                  </p>
                  <p>In an Action brought upon a promiſe, it is uſual to ground the Action upon one promiſe, in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of it, but to lay the promiſe divers wayes and by different words in the Declaration, to the intent that upon the tryal, the Plaintiff may reſt, or rely upon that way of laying it, that his wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes are beſt able to prove. <hi>Mich.</hi> 24. <hi>Car.

                  <p>If one be indebted to another, and do promiſe to pay this debt at a day to come, the party to whom he made this promiſe, cannot bring his Action for the Debt untill the day be paſſed upon which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to pay it, By <hi>Rolle Chief Juſtice,</hi> and by <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Juſtice; for he ſaid that the promiſe is a ſuſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Debt. <hi>pro tempore,</hi> 29. <hi>Jan.</hi> 1650. <hi>B.

For if one of the parties (alone) ſhould pay the Coſts, upon bringing the Iſſue (again) to be tryed by the ſame Jury, as the courſe is ſo to do, it would be a ſufficient matter for him that did not joyn in paying the Coſts, to challeng the Jury for favor to him that did pay the Coſts.</hi> Trin. 22.

                  <p>If a Judgement be obtained, but the Plaintiff doth take out no Execution upon this Judgement, in two whole years next after the Judgement given: The Plaintiff cannot then take out Execution, untill he have revived this Judgement by a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> which Writ he may have without motion, by the courſe of practice of the Court; but if there be an old Judgement, upon which no Execution hath been taken out, ſuch a Judgement cannot be revived by a <hi>Scire facias,</hi> without a motion, and leave of the Court. <hi>Mich.</hi> 22. <hi>Car.

                  <p>The Defendant hath all the Term, wherein a Judgement was given againſt him to ſpeak any thing to arreſt it; For the Judgement is all the Term, wherein it was given in the breaſt of the Judges, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to make it a Judgment, or not, although it be entred upon Record. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 23. <hi>Car.</hi> and 24. <hi>Car.

                  <p>The courſe for one to acknowledge a Judgement, is for him that doth acknowledge it, to give a general Warrant of Atturney for any Atturney or ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Atturney of that Court, where the Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is to be acknowledged to appear for him at his ſuite, who is to have the Judgement acknowledged unto him, and to receive a Declaration from him, and to plead <hi>Non ſum informatus,</hi> and thereupon Judgement is entred for want of a Plea. 14. <hi>Nov.</hi> 1650. <hi>B.

                  <p>By <hi>Rolle</hi> Chief Juſtice, a Judgement ought not to be entred for want of a Councellors hand ſet unto a ſpecial Plea, as by the Rules of the Court, there ought to be, without firſt acquainting of the Seconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of the intention to enter Judgement, for ſuch a Plea without a Councellors hand, is a Plea, and it may be there needeth not a ſpecial Plea, and the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty muſt not be his own Judge, whether it be good or no. <hi>B.

                  <p>If moneys be upon a motion ordered to be brought into the Court, and are accordingly brought in, they ought not to be taken out of the

                  </p>
                  <p>If any thing be moved to the Court upon a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, if the Record upon which the motion is made be not in Court when the motion is made, the Court will make no Rule upon ſuch a motion. <hi>Hill.</hi> 22. <hi>Car.

For the Court will be ſatisfied by the Record, whether the matter of the Record upon which the motion is grounded, be ſo as is ſuggeſted by the Councell, and will not reſt upon ſuggeſtions made at the bar.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If there be divers Rules of the Court made in a Cauſe, and the party intends to move upon theſe Rules, he muſt produce the Rule that was laſt made in the Cauſe, and move upon that. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 23. <hi>Car.

                  </p>
                  <p>One party ought not to ſurpriſe another by a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Court, but he ought to move in ſuch conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient time, that the other party againſt whom the motion is made, may have time to be heard, and to make his Defence. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 23. <hi>Car.

                  <p>When a thing queſtionable between the parties is to be moved to the Court, for the ſetling thereof; he that intends to move it muſt give the adverſe party timely notice of the time (as near as he can) when he will move it. <hi>Mich.</hi> 1650. <hi>B.

                  <p>The three laſt dayes of the Term, if it be not an Iſſue Term, is appointed to hear motions only, and not other buſineſſes, except they be peremptory, or upon other ſpecial occaſions; But if it be not an Iſſue Term, then the two laſt dayes are only for the hearing of motions. 30. <hi>Jan.</hi> 1650. <hi>B.

                  <p>If the Plaintiff give the Defendant Notice for a try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al againſt him, and do not try his cauſe the ſame Term he gave Notice for the tryal, he ought by the Rules of the Court to give the Defendant new Notice before he proceed to a tryal afterwards; but if the Plaintiff do try his cauſe the ſame Term wherein he gave Notice he would try his cauſe, although it be at another day after the day he gave Notice he would try it; yet he is not bound to give new Notice before he try it, for the Defendant is bound to attend the try-all at his own perill. <hi>Mich.</hi> 22. <hi>Car. B. r. So it is where Notice is given for a tryal at the Aſſizes, and by reaſon of multiplicity of buſineſs, the cauſe cannot be tryed at that Aſſizes: but though the cauſe cannot be tryed at one day of that Aſſizes, yet it may be tryed at another day, and therefore the parties muſt attend all the Aſſizes at their perill without further Notice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If Notice for a tryal be given to the Defendant himſelf, or to his Atturney, this is a good Notice; but if Notice be given thereof to the Councel of the Defendant, it is not a good Notice. <hi>Hill.</hi> 22. <hi>Car. B. r. For Councel are not bound to take notice of ſuch a warning for a tryal; nor to give the Clyent Notice thereof, and it may be though one have been formerly of Councel with the Defendant in other buſineſs, or in
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:100357:123"/> the cauſe to be tryed, yet he may not be of Councel at the tryal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Plaintiff and Defendant are both bound to take Notice of ſuch Rules of the Court as do concern the proceedings of their cauſe, at their own perills. <hi>Hill.</hi> 22. <hi>Car. B. r. For if they know them not, yet they may inform themſelves by their Councel and At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turneys. But this is onely to be underſtood of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rules and not of particular rules made upon the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of either party, for of ſuch rules their ought to be notice given to the party concerned. Paſc.</hi> 24. <hi>Car. B. r.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When Councel are to argue a matter in Law in Court, the Judges ought to have Notice thereof gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven unto them before the day, except it be where the Court have appointed a ſet day for it, or if there be not ſuch Notice given, then the cauſe is to be put in the paper of cauſes, that it may come on in courſe to be ſpoken unto. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r. By put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it in the paper, the Judges have Notice, for they have a paper of the cauſes to be ſpoken to in matter of Law the day before they be ſpoken to by the Officer of the Court.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Officers in Court ought to take Notice of the proceedings of the cauſes depending in Court. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r. For, for that cauſe do they ſit in Court.</hi>

                  <p>If the Plaintiff or his Atturney do give Notice un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Sollicitor of the Defendant, that he intends to try his cauſe at ſuch a time, this is a good Notice of the tryal, although it be not given unto the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant nor his Atturney. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r. For it is the duty of the Sollicitor to inform his Clyent of it, and if he do it not, it ſhall be accounted the folly of the
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:100357:124"/> Clyent, to entertain a Sollicitor that is ſo careleſs in his buſineſs, and in this caſe there is no default in the Plaintiff.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Defendant ought to have eight dayes Notice of the tryal of the Plaintiffs cauſe before it be tryed, if he live twenty or thirty miles off from the place where the cauſe is to be tryed; but if he live further off, he ought to have fourteen dayes Notice before the tryal. <hi>Trin.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r. That the Defendant may have convenient time for his journey, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare his Councel and witneſſes for his tryal.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Plaintiff may if he pleaſe give the Defendant Notice when he intends to try his cauſe the ſame day that he hath joyned Iſſue with the Defendant in the cauſe to be tryed betwixt them. <hi>Trin.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r.</hi>

                  <p>If one be bound by the rule of the Court, to give unto another perſonal Notice of a thing, it is not ſufficient that Notice be left at the dwelling houſe of the party. <hi>Mich.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r. For perſonal Notice is Notice given to the perſon of the party himſelf, and not to another.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not neceſſary for the Plaintiff to give new No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the tryal of his cauſe where a <hi>retraxit</hi> is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred; for this is but a forbearance to try his cauſe <hi>hac vice,</hi> and he may afterwards proceed notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the <hi>retraxit</hi> was entred. <hi>Mich.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r. The entring of a</hi> retraxit <hi>is when the Plaintiff after he hath entred his cauſe to be tryed, and hath put in his Record, doth make an entry in the Judges book, that he hath withdrawn his record, and intends not then to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to his tryal.</hi>

                  <p>When either the Plaintiff or Defendant doth intend to move the Court in any matter which may prove diſputable, the party that thus intends to move, ought to give Notice to the other party, that he doth intend to move the Court in it, and to expreſs for what he will move, and when. <hi>Mich.</hi> 1650. <hi>B.

                  </p>
                  <p>If the Plaintiff doth tell the Defendant that he will try his cauſe the firſt ſitting in the next Term, this is a good Notice given of the tryal, although he do not expreſely ſay upon what day of the moneth or week it is. <hi>Mich.</hi> 1649. <hi>B.

                  <p>If the Plaintiff do give unto the Defendant Notice for a Tryal, before Iſſue is joyned in the Cauſe, this is no good Notice. <hi>Hill.</hi> 1649. 5. <hi>Feb. B. S. For before Iſſue joyned, there is nothing to be tried, and ſo this is a vain Notice, and to no purpoſe, and it may be there will never be any Iſſue or Tryal, and ſo the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if he ſhould attend upon ſuch Notice, might loſe his pains and coſts.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>It is a ſufficient Notice for the Plaintiffs Attorney to tell the Defendants Attorney that he hath put in a Declaration into the Office againſt his Clyent, and he is not bound to give him a Copy of it. 13. <hi>Nov.</hi> 1650. <hi>B. S. For there he may take a Copy of it,

                  <p>If one be bound by an <hi>Aſſumpſit</hi> to do a thing to another, he to whom the promiſe is made muſt give him Notice when he will have him do it, but if he promiſe that another perſon ſhall do it to him, there he to whom the thing is to be done; is not bound to give Notice to that other perſon when he will have it done. 13. <hi>May.</hi> 1651. <hi>Paſc.

For it is intended that his Attorney was in Court when it was made, and that he did take notice of it, or elſe that there needs no Notice in the Caſe, becauſe, that the party ought to have done that which he is ordered to do, without a ſpecial Rule made in the Caſe.</hi>

                  <p>If a Cauſe be ready for Tryal, and Notice is thereupon given of the Trial, and afterwards the Cauſe is put to a reference, and doth depend two or three Terms under reference, and being not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, the Plaintiff intends to proceed to a Trial, there he muſt give the Defendant new Notice; but if ſuch Trial be to be the next Term after the refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, it is not neceſſary to give new Notice of it, for it may be tried by proviſo. <hi>Trin.</hi> 1652. <hi>B.

Becauſe it lies in the Election of the Defendant, either to try the Cauſe by proviſo, or not to try it: And the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff cannot preſume he will try it, being Defendant in the Action, except the Defendant give him Notice that he will try it.</hi>

                  <p>If a Sheriff take a Bond of the Defendant for his apparance to the Action, upon which he is arreſted by the Sheriff at the Plaintiffs ſute, and the Defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant doth not appear accordingly, and according to the Condition of the Bond, the Plaintiff may by the leave of the Sheriff ſue this Bond in the Sheriffs name, and proceed to Judgement upon it againſt the Defendant; but without his leave it cannot be done, but it is at the election of the Plaintiff to ſue this Bond or not, for he may proceed if he pleaſe by amercements upon the Sheriff, untill he make a retorn of the Writ directed unto him. <hi>Hill.</hi> 22. <hi>Car.

For the Bond is only to ſave the Sheriff harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs againſt what may befall him, if the Defendant do not appear, and doth no way concern the Plaintiff, but by agreement made afterwards betwixt the Plaintiff and him, of which the Court doth not take notice, except they be moved in it.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>If money be not paid according to the Condition of an Obligation, the Obligation doth thereby be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a ſingle Obligation, that is, it ſhall be taken as an Obligation without a Condition, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of the Condition, which the Obligor might have taken advantage of by the paiment of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney according to the Condition, is loſt by the not paying of it, and ſo the Obligation reſts in force, as if it had no Condition. <hi>Mich.</hi> 24. <hi>Car.

                  <p>If an Action be grounded upon a Statute, there the Statute muſt be preciſely ſet forth in pleading; but if a Statute recited be but an inducement to the action, there it is not neceſſary to recite the Statute preciſely. <hi>Hill.</hi> 21. <hi>Car.

                  <p>As a plea in bar may go <hi>per partes,</hi> ſo may in like manner a plea pleaded in abatement of a Writ. <hi>Hil.</hi> 21. <hi>Car. B. r. A Plea is then ſaid to go</hi> per partes, <hi>as I conceive, when one part of it goes to one part of the Declaration, and another part of the Plea anſwers ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the Declaration.</hi>

                  <p>A forraign Plea is when the Defendant doth plead ſuch matter, that if it be true, the cauſe cannot be tried in this Court; and in regard that thereby the Defendant doth endeavour to hinder the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of this Court, and to delay the Plaintiff, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Court will make him ſwear his Plea to be true, that the Court may not be deluded, nor the Plaintiff trifled with by a falſe Plea, and if he will not ſwear his Plea to be true, the Plaintiff may enter Judgement for want of a Plea. <hi>Trin.</hi> 1650. <hi>B.

                  <p>If the Defendant do plead a dilatory Plea, the Court at the Plaintiffs motion will order him to plead ſuch a Plea, as he will ſtand to. <hi>Mich.</hi> 22. <hi>Car.
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:100357:135"/> B. r. For the Law favours not delayes, whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is vainly babled by the ignorant to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.

                  <p>When the Court doth order one to plead preſently, it is to be underſtood that he ſhall plead in ſuch convenient time after, as the Court ſhall judge reaſonable. <hi>Mich.</hi> 22. <hi>Car. B. r.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Defendant may amend his Plea, although it be three Terms after it was pleaded, if he will pay Coſts. <hi>Mich.</hi> 22. <hi>Car. B. r. But it muſt be by leave of the Court, becauſe it is againſt the common Rules of practice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Although a Plea do contain divers matters in it, upon which an Iſſue may be taken, yet this Plea is not double, if the Plea could not have been good, without alleadging all thoſe matters in it. <hi>Mich.</hi> 22. <hi>Car. B. r. For though the Law doth not allow captious Pleas, yet it doth not deny the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant to plead all ſuch matters that his Caſe affords for his juſt Defence.</hi>

                  <p>If the Defendant Plead an inſufficient Plea, and there is a good Iſſue joyned upon that Plea, and a Verdict given upon that Iſlue for the Defendant; the Plaintiff ſhall not afterwards take advantage of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſufficiency of the Plea. <hi>Mich.</hi> 22. <hi>Car.

                  <p>Where one Pleads Letters of Adminiſtration, which are granted by ſuch an ordinary, whereof the Law doth take notice, he may Plead that they were granted unto him <hi>debito more;</hi> but if they be granted by an inferior ordinary, of whom the Law doth not take notice of, he muſt Plead that they were granted unto him <hi>per ordinarum illius loci.</hi> Mich. 22.

                  <p>In an Appeal brought, all the Pleadings ought to be in <hi>French. Mich.</hi> 22. <hi>Car. B. r. Becauſe the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute which enacted that all Pleadings ſhould be in La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin, extends not to this Action, and ſo the Pleadings therein are to be in</hi> French, <hi>as all Pleadings were before that Statute.

                  </p>
                  <p>When the Court doth order that the Defendant
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:100357:136"/> ſhall Plead, it is intended that he muſt Plead an Iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Plea. <hi>Mich.</hi> 22. <hi>Car. B. r. For the rule is made to quicken the Defendant, that the Plaintiff be not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed by his Dilatorineſs, and if he might Plead a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latory Plea, and not iſſueable, the rule would be to no purpoſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Court will not upon a motion, rule the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant to Plead peremptorily by a day, before the common rules of the Court for Pleading be out, but then they will. <hi>Mich.</hi> 22. <hi>Car. B. r. For till then it cannot be ſaid that the Defendant hath delayed the Plaintiff.</hi>

                  <p>If a <hi>Scire facias</hi> upon a Recognizance, be brought againſt an Infant, he cannot Plead Infancy or non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to it; but he muſt bring his <hi>audita querela,</hi> and ſet forth his caſe therein, and thereby his age ſhall be tryed by the Courts inſpecting of him, and not by a Jury. <hi>Hill.</hi> 22. <hi>Car.

                  <p>If the Plaintiff do releaſe his cauſe of Action to the Defendant, yet the Court will not upon a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſtop the Plaintiffs proceedings in the Action, but the Defendant muſt Plead this releaſe. <hi>Hill.</hi> 22. <hi>Car.

                  </p>
                  <p>It is not a good Plea, to Plead a Paroll agreement in bar of an agreement made by indenture between the parties. <hi>Hill.</hi> 22. <hi>Car. B. r. For an agreement by Indenture is a more ſolemn agreement, and of a higher nature then a Paroll agreement, and muſt be diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome act of as high a nature as it is.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A double Plea is ſuch a Plea, that one Iſſue cannot determine all the matter iſſuable that is contained in it, and alſo where the Defendant is put to a double an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. <hi>Hill.</hi> 22. <hi>Car. B. r. And ſuch a Plea is not a good Plea.</hi>

                  <p>If the Defendant do Plead a frivolous Plea, to the intent to delay the Plaintiff, and to hinder him from going to a tryal, the Court will upon the Plaintiffs motion, order the Defendant to plead ſuch a Plea as he will ſtand to, or elſe to accept of a Demurrer from the Plaintiff unto his frivolous Plea. <hi>Hill.</hi> 22. <hi>Car.

For it is the Juſtice of the Court to ſpeed the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings in Law, and to bring ſuits to determination as ſoon as with conveniency and Juſtice to all parties, it may be done.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>By the courſe of practice in the Court of Common Pleas, the principle in a Bond may Plead for his Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty without his leave or knowledge, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge a Judgement upon the Bond, but this Court doth judge it hard practice, and will not allow it to be don here. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r. Now it is ſaid they do not allow it there. The practice ſeemed hard in this reſpect, that the Suerty, who intended onely to be bound that the principal ſhould pay the Debt, ſhould by the falſity of the principal, be preſently liable to an Execution for the Debt, and be enforced to pay it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where the Defendant may plead the general Iſſue, he ought ſo to Plead, that the whole matter in queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on may come to be tryed. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r. For elſe the Plea is not good, becauſe it tenders not ſuch an Iſſue whereupon the cauſe depending may be determined, which every Plea ought to do, for to Plead otherwayes, is to no purpoſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If one bring an Action upon a contract, it is a good Plea in bar for the Defendant to Plead, <hi>quod ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oneravit ſe de Contractu.</hi> Paſc. 23. Car. B. r. <hi>For it ſounds all one, as if he had Pleaded that he hath per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the agreement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Concord by Paroll is no good Plea in bar to an
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:100357:137"/> Action brought upon a ſingle Bill which is not penall. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r. For bare words are not of ſo great force as agreements put in writting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Every Plea muſt be Pleaded either in bar to the Action brought, or in abatement of the Writ upon which the Action is framed, otherwiſe it is but a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe and not a Plea, becauſe the Plaintiff cannot take an Iſſue upon it, and therefore if the Plaintiff do demur upon it, and his demurrer be adjudged good, he ſhall have Judgement againſt the Defendant. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Anciently all Pleadings were in <hi>French,</hi> then by the Statute it was Enacted they ſhould be in Latin. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r. Now by a late Act they muſt be in</hi> Engliſh <hi>and not written in Court-hand.</hi>

                  <p>If the Plaintiff do put in a Replication to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants Plea, the Defendant ought to Plead unto it, although it did not come in, in due time, according to the courſe of the Court. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Court will not direct any perſon how to plead, although the matter be difficult, though they be moved to do it, but will bid them Plead at their own perils. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r. For Councel are to adviſe how to Plead, and the Court is onely to Judge of the Pleadings, whether they be good in Law or not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A thing ought not to be Pleaded by implication, but in expreſs words. <hi>Trin.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r. For there can be no Iſſue taken upon it, becauſe it is not a direct affirmative, but by ſuppoſition.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>If one Plead a Deed, he muſt produce it in Court, but one may give a Deed in evidence, although he cannot produce it, if he can make it out by proofs that there was ſuch a Deed, and ſo he may do of a Record. <hi>Trin.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r. For upon Pleading of a Deed, it is fit that the Defendant have a ſight of it, that he may know what defence to make, which he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not (it may be) do without a ſight of it, and every Plea ſhall be taken to be true, except it be denyed, but an evidence is believed or not believed, as the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of things do weigh with the Jury.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where the Defendant is not conſtrained to Plead a ſpecial Plea, he may Plead the general iſſue proper for the Action brought, and give the ſpecial matter in evidence. <hi>Hill.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r. For every Plea muſt be ſo framed that it may give a full anſwer to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſet forth in the Declaration, to wit, all ſuch as are material to be anſwered unto.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It hath been adjudged a good Plea in a <hi>Scire Facias</hi> brought againſt an Executor upon an Obligation en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into by the Teſtator, to Plead fully Adminiſtred, but it is better for him to Plead that no goods of the Teſtators are come to his hands with which he could ſatisfie the Debt, <hi>viz.</hi> ſince the bringing of the Writ of <hi>Scire facias</hi> againſt him. <hi>Mich.</hi> 22. <hi>Car.

                  <p>One may Plead a matter in Law, although it do amount to no more then a <hi>non culp. Mich.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r. For if the party be not guilty by Law, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding that which is alleadged againſt him be true, it is all one as if the matter alleadged againſt him were not true; for no man is further guilty of a thing then the Law makes him guilty.</hi>

                  <p>If one Plead an ill Plea, and the Plaintiff joyns iſſue upon this Plea, and a Verdict is thereupon found for

                  <p>A Plea may be amended upon leave of the Court, if it be but in paper and not entred, but the party that amends it, muſt pay coſts unto the other. <hi>Hill.</hi> 23. <hi>Car.

                  </p>
                  <p>A Clerk of the Court ought not to refuſe a Plea, although it be not put in in time, but the Plaintiff muſt move the Court, and abide by their rule therein. <hi>Hill.</hi> 23. <hi>Car.

                  <p>That Pleading of payment upon an Action brought upon a penal Bill, without ſhewing an acquittance, is but a Plea in abatement of the Writ, but with an acquittance, it is a Plea in diſcharge of the Action it ſelf. <hi>Trin.</hi> 24. <hi>Car. B. r.</hi> Q.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>A Plea in abatement of the Writ, ought not to be received after the Defendant hath Emparled, yet if it be received, and the Plaintiff doth demur to it, the demurrer is good. <hi>Trin.</hi> 24. <hi>Car.

For the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs accepting of the Plea after imparlance, is no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the Defendant, and therefore it is but reaſon that he ſhould take advantage of the inſufficiency of the Plea, by demurring to it, if he ſee cauſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is intended in Law, that every Plea is entred when it is Pleaded, for anciently the Serjeants at Law did uſe to Plead all the Pleas in Court at the bar. <hi>Trin.</hi> 24. <hi>Car. B. r. And before they were entred they could not Plead them.</hi>

But a Plea in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batement is onely dilatory, and is not to bring the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in queſtion to an Iſſue, but to delay the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff.</hi>

                  <p>If one Plead a Plea that is not good, and the Plaintiff doth demur upon it, he cannot afterwards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend that Plea, without the Plaintiffs conſent. <hi>Mich.</hi> 24. <hi>Car.

                  <p>A Dilatory Plea ought to be Pleaded upon the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the firſt rule in the Office for the Defendant to Plead, and a Plea in the chief muſt be pleaded af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the ſecond Rule given in the Office for the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant to Plead; and this is the reaſon that Judgement cannot be entred againſt the Defendant for want of a Plea, untill the time given by the two rules to Plead be paſt. <hi>Mich.</hi> 24. <hi>Car.

                  <p>Where a matter to be tryed by a Jury doth concern the title or intereſt of the Under-Sheriff, there the Jury that is to try this matter, is to be returned by the High-Sheriff, and not the Under-Sheriff. <hi>Trin.</hi> 24. <hi>Car.

                  <p>NOtice to an under-tenant of a houſe or land, that there is a Leaſe of Ejectment ſealed and delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Try the title of the thing of which he is in poſſeſſion, is no good notice in reſpect to the upper tenant thereof, or to him in reverſion whoſe title is properly concerned; and therefore if there be a Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and a Verdict, and a Judgement, in ſuch a caſe where there was notice onely given to the under-te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant as aforeſaid, the Court upon a motion and proof of this matter, will vacate ſuch a Judgement as a fraudulent Judgement. <hi>Hill.</hi> 21. <hi>Car. B. r. For it is deceitfully obtained as to him in the reverſion whoſe title is concerned in the Judgement.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No tryal ought to be had at the Bar, the ſame Term that the Defendants plea is put in, but the Term following by the Rules of the Court. <hi>Hill.</hi> 21. <hi>Car. B. r. Except it be by ſpecial rule of Court, or in cauſes depending on the Crown ſide, wherein the King is a party.</hi>

                  <p>This Court will grant a <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> to Try a Felon at the Bar, although the Felony was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the County of <hi>Middleſex,</hi> iſthere be not a Gaol Delivery in the uſuall manner in the County where the Felony was committed. <hi>Hill.</hi> 21. <hi>Car. B. r. This is done for the expedition of Juſtice, and that the priſoner may not lye long in priſon, for the Law favors liberty.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Tryal in that Court where the iſſue Tryed was not joyned, is not a good Tryal. <hi>Hill.</hi> 21. <hi>Car. B. r. For there was nothing before them to Try, and ſo it was</hi> Coram non judice.</p>

                  <p>Where the Plaintiff will not Try his cauſe in ſuch due time as he ought to do, by the Rules of the Court the Defendant may upon warning given thereof to the Plaintiff proceed to the Tryal of it himſelf. <hi>Hill.</hi> 21. <hi>Car.

                  <p>Juſtices of Peace may by there Commiſſion Try a murder committed in the County where they are Juſtices. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 22. <hi>Car. B. r. But they do not often do it, but leave ſuch matters to be Tryed by the Juſtice of the Gaol Delivery at the Aſſizes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If any of the Defendants Witneſſes to be uſed at a Tryal, do live above fourty miles diſtant from <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don;</hi> the Plaintiff by the Rules of the Court ought to give the Defendant fourteen dayes notice of the Tryal before he Try his cauſe. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 21. <hi>Car.

                  <p>Upon a Tryal at the Bar, when the Jury is at the Bar, and the Court ready, and the panell of the Jurors names is delivered to the Secondary, he bids the cryer call the Defendant, which he doth, and if his Councel ſay they appear, then the Secondary bids both parties take heed to their challenges, and then proceeds to ſwear the Jurors; but if he do not appear after thrice calling by the Cryer, the Plaintiffs Councel do pray the Court the Verdict may be taken by default. <hi>Trin.</hi> 24. <hi>Car. B. r. It is called a Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict by default, becauſe if it paſs againſt the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant, where the Defendant had right, and might have defended himſelf; it is not the fault of the Court or Jury, but his own, that would not appear and defend his cauſe.</hi>

                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:100357:173"/>
                  <p>Where a Tryal is had by proviſoe, the Plaintiff may be called before the Jury is ſworn, if the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant do require it. <hi>Trin.</hi> 22. <hi>Car. B. r. For the Plaintiff is as it were in the place of the Defendant, becauſe the cauſe is brought to a Tryal by the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Court will not grant a Tryal at the bar, except there be oath made, that the matter to be Tryed is very difficult, or of great value. <hi>Mich.</hi> 22. <hi>Car. B. r. In which caſes it is fit the Tryal ſhould be at the Bar, where Tryals are more ſolemn, and where more time may be ſpent in the Tryal then can be at the Aſſizes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After a Tryal hath been in a cauſe, the Court ought not to order that there ſhall be a new Tryal of it, except it doth appear that there was a ſurpriſall in the Tryal had, or ſome fraudulent miſcarriage in it; for if they might in any caſe they pleaſe, order a new Tryal, this would be for the Court to have an Arbitrary power, which the Law will not permit. <hi>Mich.</hi> 22. <hi>Car. B. r. For this would weaken the Common Laws to the prejudice of the people.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where warning is given of a Tryal to the Attur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in the cauſe, and the Atturney cannot give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this warning timely enough for his Clyent to prepare for the Tryal, the Court will not force the Atturney to go to a Tryal, but will give longer time. <hi>Mich.</hi> 22. <hi>Car. B. r. Becauſe the Court will not ſurpriſe any perſon, and ſuch Tryals very ſeldome do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the buſineſs, but beget more trouble and charges to both parties.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where there ought to have been a place alleadged whence the <hi>venue</hi> ſhould come, and there is no place alleadged, but an iſſue is joyned, and the <hi>venire</hi> is
<pb n="311" facs="tcp:100357:173"/> 
                     <hi>de corpore comitasus,</hi> and a Tryal is thereupon had, this is good Tryal, and there ought not to be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleader. <hi>Mich.</hi> 22. <hi>Car. B. r. For here is a good pleading and a good iſſue joyned and well Tryed, and a repleader is to be onely where the Pleading is vicious, and hath not brought the iſſue in queſtion, which was to have been Tryed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Court do know that the Jury have given their Verdict againſt the evidence given unto them, they may order a new Tryal to be in the caſe. <hi>Mich.</hi> 22. <hi>Car. B. r.</hi> Q. Tamen, <hi>For the Jury are upon their Oaths, and it may be they know ſomething of their own knowledge more then the evidence which moved them to give their Verdict ſo, and the party againſt whom the Verdict is given, is not without remedy, for he may bring his Attaint againſt the Jury; yet new Tryals have ſometimes</hi> de facto <hi>been awardes in ſuch oaſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There may be a good Tryal in a cauſe, although the Defendants plea be ill. <hi>Hill.</hi> 22. <hi>Car. B. r. For the Tryal depends not upon the plea, but upon the iſſue joyned; and if there be a good iſſue joyned, the Tryal is good, what ever the plea be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Where the Plaintiff will not try his cauſe after iſſue is joyned, the Defendant may try it afterwards when he pleaſeth. <hi>Hill.</hi> 22. <hi>Car. B. r. That he may free himſelf from the ſute.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Defendants Atturney hath told the Plaintiffs Atturney what plea he will plead, the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs Atturney may give him warning for a Tryal, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the iſſue be not made up in the cauſe. <hi>Hill.</hi> 22. <hi>Car. B. r. For after plea pleaded, it is in the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiffs choice whether he will reply or no, for he may make up the iſſue when he pleaſeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="312" facs="tcp:100357:174"/>
                  <p>If a cauſe to be tryed, be not entred into the Judges Book, before whom it is to be tryed four dayes before the cauſe is to be tryed, the Plaintiff may enter a <hi>ne receipiatur</hi> in the Judges book; that it may not be entred after that to be tryed at that time if the Defendant pleaſe. <hi>Hill.</hi> 22. <hi>Car. B. r.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If upon a Tryal to be had at the Bar, the Jury be not ready at the day to try the cauſe, the cauſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be tryed at the Bar any other day of that Term, without the conſent of both parties. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r. For it would be too long to keep the Witneſſes in Town to another day; and if they ſhould go out of Town, it might be too ſhort a time, and too much trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to bring them up again the ſame Term.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The agitation of a cauſe in one Court, is no cauſe to put off the Tryal of the ſame cauſe depending in another Court. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r. For the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of one Court of Law, ought not to claſh with the proceedings of another Court, but it is not ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt the Courts of Law and the Chancery, as it is a Court of equity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The King may try his own cauſe in what Court he pleaſeth. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r. By his prerogatine; for they are all his Courts, and it is not reaſonable he ſhould be ſtreightned in his choice where he will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A local matter generally, is not to be tryed in a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign County, but in the County where the cauſe of Action ariſeth. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r. For there may the beſt knowledge of the matter be had, and it is alſo for the greater eaſe of the people, and leſs charge.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If one be committed to the Gaol for one Felony, yet the Juſtices may try him for another Felony, for
<pb n="313" facs="tcp:100357:174"/> which he was not committed. <hi>Trin.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r. By</hi> Bacon <hi>Juſtice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Decree in <hi>Chancery</hi> ſhall be tryed by a Jury and not by it ſelf, for it is not a Record, but it is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree recorded. <hi>Mich.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r. And there is difference betwixt a Record and a thing recorded, for a Record is a Judgement or other act recorded, done in a Court of Record, but the</hi> Chancery <hi>as it is a Court of equity, is not a Court of Record, but an arbitrary Court, although it be a Court of Record as touching things agitated in the pettibag Office.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Although the Plaintiff after iſſue joyned, and at the Aſſizes where he was to try his cauſe, do enter a <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traxit,</hi> yet he may try the cauſe at the next Aſſizes after if he pleaſe, for the <hi>retraxit</hi> doth onely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, that he intends to forbear to try his cauſe, <hi>hac vice</hi> onely; and if he do not try it at the next Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſizes after, then the Defendant may, if he will, try it by proviſoe; and if the Defendant do not then try it by proviſoe, the Plaintiff may give new notice of a Tryal to the Defendant, and try it at the next Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſizes following. <hi>Mich.</hi> 23. <hi>Car.

                  </p>
                  <p>One that is not ſerved with proceſs to give his teſtimony at a Tryal, may not be examined upon a <hi>veire dire</hi> concerning any matter which concerns the Tryal. <hi>Mich.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r.</hi>

                  <p>A Tryal at the Bar ought not to be had for houſes lying within the City of <hi>London. Mich.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Plaintiff give notice to the Defendant that he will try his cauſe that Term, although it be not tryed at the day appointed, yet he is not bound to give new notice of a Tryal, if he try it any time within that Term, for one notice is ſufficient for
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:100357:175"/> the whole Term. <hi>Hill.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>According to the old uſe of practice in this Court, there ought to be but ten Tryals at the Bar in <hi>Eaſter</hi> Term. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 24. <hi>Car. B. r. Becauſe Tryals at the Bar are a great hindrance to other buſineſſes which are more proper for the Court, yet now they are encreaſed many times to donble the number.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If there be warning given for a Tryal, and no Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry appear at the day, there ought to be a new notice given if the party will try his cauſe at another day. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 24. <hi>Car. B. r.</hi>

                  <p>The conſent of the owner of the Land, to make one Ejector to try the title of the Land, is good if it be not a plot betwixt him and the Ejector to <hi>ouſt</hi> the Leſſee of the Land of his poſſeſſion. <hi>Mich.</hi> 24. <hi>Car. B. r.</hi>

                  <p>A Tryal at the Bar may not be had by the conſent of the parties without leave of the Court. <hi>Mich.</hi> 24. <hi>Car. B. r. For the Court is not bound</hi> Ex Officio <hi>to grant a Tryal at the Bar, but it is in their diſcretion to grant it, or not to grant it.</hi>

                  <p>In a Tryal for ſubſtracting of tithes in an Action grounded upon the Statute of 2. <hi>Ed.</hi> 6. the Plaintiff ought firſt to begin with the proof of the value of the Tithes, before he proceeds to ſhew his title to them. <hi>Mich.</hi> 24. <hi>Car. B. r.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is a miſ-tryal for a thing to be tryed before a Judge, who hath intereſt in the thing in queſtion, and the requeſt or conſent of the parties concerned in the Tryal will not help it. <hi>Mich.</hi> 24. <hi>Car. B. r. For ſuch a Tryal cannot be ſuppoſed to be indifferent, for none ought to be Judge in his own cauſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A miſ tryall is helped by the Statute of <hi>Jeofailes,</hi> but not a voide Tryal, to wit, where there is no iſſue
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:100357:175"/> joyned to be tryed; but in ſuch caſes there muſt be a repleader, that the matter in queſtion may be put in iſſue to be tryed. <hi>Mich.</hi> 24, <hi>Car. B. r.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The day for a Tryal ought to be entred into the Clerks book in the Office, <hi>viz.</hi> the Clerk of the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. <hi>Mich.</hi> 1649. <hi>B. S.

                  <p>One that is a priviledged perſon in this Court, ought not by reaſon of his priviledge onely, to have a Tryal at the Bar granted unto him, but there muſt be difficulty in the matter to be tryed, or elſe it muſt be of great value. <hi>Hill.</hi> 1649. <hi>B.

                  <p>A Tryal at the Bar ought not to be granted before the Defendant hath pleaded, and iſſue be joyned. <hi>Hill.</hi> 1649. <hi>B.

                  <p>By the ancient practice of the Court, all the Try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als at the Bar which are had in <hi>Eaſter</hi> Term ought to be tryed a fortnight before the end of the Term.

                  <p>The proſecutor in an information brought in this Court, ought to bring the cauſe to a Tryal at his own coſts, but in an Endictment which is folely at the ſute of the King, he that is Endicted muſt bring the cauſe to a Tryal at his own charges. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 1650. <hi>B.

                  <p>The teſtimony of one ſingle perſon, is a ſufficient teſtimony for the King in a cauſe wherein he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. <hi>Mich.</hi> 22. <hi>Car. B. r. To wit, in criminal cauſes; but</hi> Q. <hi>Whether it be ſo in civil cauſes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Witneſs that is to teſtifie on the behalf of the King againſt one that is arraigned for Felony, may not be ſworn againſt the King to give his teſtimony, but the priſoner may examine him, &amp; deſire his teſtimony without giving him his oath. <hi>Mich.</hi> 22. <hi>Car. B. r.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If divers perſons be made parties to a ſute, and ſome of them are either found not guilty, or elſe the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff will give no evidence againſt them, they may be allowed to be examined as witneſſes in the cauſe whereunto they were made parties. <hi>Mich.</hi> 22. <hi>Car. B. r. For now it appears they are not concerned in the ſute but are as ſtrangers and indifferent perſons.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He that will make uſe of Witneſſes at a tryal, muſt get them thither at his own peril, and he ſhall not delay the other party for lack of his Witneſſes. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r. For he hath his remedy againſt his Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, if he ſuffer in his tryal by reaſon of their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One that hath but a ſmall Legacy given unto him by a Will, may be allowed as a Witneſs to prove that will; but he that hath Lands given unto him, by a Wil, may not be allowed for a Witneſs to prove that Will. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r. For that were to ſuffer one to ſwear his own title, but in the former caſe
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:100357:195"/> the Law will not intend that any one will forſwear him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for a ſmall matter.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is not requiſite for Witneſſes to a Will, to ſet their hands unto it. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r. Nor for Witneſſes to a Deed to do it, but it is very prudential to do it, the better to keep things in memory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A man may be a credible Witneſſes that is one of good fame and credit, and yet by Rules of the Law, he may not be a Witneſs in the cauſe, wherein he is produced to his give teſtimony. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r. For he may be for ſome by reſpect not indifferent in that particular cauſe, though otherwiſe accounted of good credit and repute.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One that is made Executor of a Will, is not to be allowed as a Witneſs to prove that Will. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r. For his own intereſt may be concerned in the proof of the Will.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Councel on both ſides at a tryal cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree what teſtimony a Witneſs in a cauſe did give, the Court will examine him again. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r. That all things may be clear and without diſpute.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Inhabitants within a Corporation, if they be not free of the Corporation, may be admitted as Witneſſes for the Corporation, as a tryal which concerns the Corporation. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r. For their intereſt is no way concerned, and favor is not a good exception a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt a Witneſs, although it he againſt a Juror.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Witneſs may not be compelled to anſwer upon a <hi>voir dire</hi> touching a Treſpaſs done for the doing whereof, he may himſelf be lyable to an Action. <hi>Mich.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r.</hi> For <hi>nemo tenetur prodere ſcipſum.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One that is of Councel in the cauſe on one ſide, may be examined as a Witneſs in it on the other ſide, if he be ſerved with Proceſs to give his teſtimony there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in,
<pb n="356" facs="tcp:100357:196"/> but otherwiſe he may refuſe to be examined. <hi>Mich.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r. For in the former caſe he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyned by Law to do it, which is to be preferred before his Clyent, but otherwiſe it is a voluntary act, and it is not civil for him to do it, nor is he to be preſſed unto it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Examination of Witneſſes which were taken <hi>in perpetuam rei memoriam</hi> ought not to be made uſe of at a tryal, until the Witneſſes ſo examined be dead. <hi>Hill.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r. Paſc.</hi> 24. <hi>Car. B. r.</hi> 19. <hi>Ap. For they were onely examined for their teſtimonies to be made uſe of onely in the caſe of death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One that is any wayes concerned in the ſame Title of the Land in queſtion, may not be allowed as a Witneſs in the cauſe, although he be no wayes then a party to the ſute. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 24. <hi>Car. B. r. For his teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony tends to the corroboration of his own title.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One that claims any benefit by a Deed, may not be allowed as a Witneſs to prove the Deed. <hi>Mich.</hi> 1649. <hi>B. r. In regard of his intereſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>One that is to be a Witneſs at a tryal ought not to be examined before the tryal, but by conſent of both parties. <hi>Hill.</hi> 1649. <hi>B. S.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Court will upon a motion grant a <hi>Habeas Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus</hi> to have a priſoner in priſon upon an Execution in the Mareſchal Sea, to be at a tryal to be examined as a Witneſs, if the tryal be in <hi>London;</hi> but he that ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> muſt carry him thither, and bring him back at his own charge and peril, that he make no eſcape. <hi>Trin.</hi> 1650. <hi>B. S.</hi> 29. <hi>Junii.</hi> Q Tamen, <hi>Whether it ought to be done where the priſoner it in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If a Witneſs be ſick, ſo that he cannot be at a tryal, and it is ſo proved by Affidavit, and that Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs hath been formerly examined upon intergatories
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:100357:196"/> in the <hi>Chancery</hi> in that matter upon which he is to be examined upon at the tryal, the intergatory may be admitted to be read in evidence to the Jury at the try<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al. 1652. <hi>B. S.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If one that hath been burnt in the hand for a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony committed by him, and be pardoned for the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, he may be admitted as a Witneſs in a cauſe. By <hi>Rolle</hi> Chief Juſtice. 1652. <hi>B. S. For by the pardon his offence is pardoned, and he is made</hi> rectus in cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria.</p>

                  <p>A Will which doth onely concern the bequeath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ought to be proved in the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cery,</hi> but if it be a mixt Will, and doth concern Lands, Goods, and Chattels alſo, it may be proved in the ſpiritual Court. <hi>Hill.</hi> 22. <hi>Car.

                  </p>
                  <p>The probate of a Will <hi>per teſtes</hi> is no corroboration of the Will. <hi>Hill.</hi> 22. <hi>Car. B. r. Although the common opinion is otherwiſe; for if it come in queſtion at the Law, whether a Will or no Will, it is no evidence to a Jury to prove it a Will, becauſe it was proved</hi> per teſtes.</p>
                  <p>A Will in writing is a good Will to convey Lands, although the Will be not ſealed. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 23. <hi>Car. B. r. For the Statute of</hi> 32. H. 8. <hi>that enables to convey Lands by Will, ſpeaks nothing of ſealing, but onely of writing ſuch wills.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Teſtator make his Will by Paroll, and do
<pb n="358" facs="tcp:100357:197"/> give direction to put his words in writing, which is done in his life time accordingly; this is a good Will to convey Lands, although he do not after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warde declare that writing to be his Will during his Life, but if his words were not put in writing till after his death, it is not a good will within the Statute to convey Lands. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 24. <hi>Car. B. For it was not his will in writing, during his life as it muſt be to convey Lands.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If the Teſtator do make his Will by Parol, which is afterwards put by another in writing by his directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and there is more expreſſed in the writing, then the Teſtator did expreſs by Paroll, yet the Will in writing is good, as to ſo much of it as can be proved was expreſſed by Paroll <hi>Paſc.</hi> 24. <hi>Car. B. r. For ſo much of it was the Teſtators will, and what is expreſſed more ſhall be void.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If a Will be made by Parol and it is afterwards put in writing, and the writing is embezeled, loſt or deſtroyed; yet is not the Will thereby deſtroyed if it can be proved by witneſſes. <hi>Paſc.</hi> 24. <hi>B. r. For the Paper is not the mind or will of the Teſtator, but onely a Declaration and Manifeſtation what his mind and will was, and if that can be made appear any other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes it ſufficieth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>A Will by which Lands are conveyed, ought not to be kept in the Prerogative Office, for it doth proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly belong to the Legatee of the Lands to ſupport his title by, if he be queſtioned for the Lands. <hi>Mich.</hi> 1649. <hi>But they may take a copy of it, and enter it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their</hi> Leiger <hi>Book.</hi>
